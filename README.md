## How the scoring model works

Every vendor is scored across four factors:

| Factor | Column | Weight | Why |
|--------|--------|--------|-----|
| Data access | C | 40% | Drives the most breach impact |
| Integration depth | D | 30% | Determines how far a breach can spread |
| Business criticality | E | 20% | Operational exposure if vendor fails |
| Security posture | F | 10% | Certifications and questionnaire response |

Each factor is scored 1 (low risk) to 3 (high risk).
The template calculates a weighted score and assigns High, Medium, or Low automatically.

**Thresholds:**
- High — score 2.5 and above → quarterly review
- Medium — score 1.5 to 2.4 → annual review
- Low — below 1.5 → biennial review

- **Scoring Guide** — complete 1–2–3 reference for every factor
