# 🔍 Vendor Risk Assessment Framework

This project showcases a practical and structured approach to vendor management and security assessments. It includes templates, evaluation criteria, and mock documentation used to assess vendor risk based on criticality, security posture, and compliance alignment.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify and assess third-party risks early in the procurement process
- Classify vendors based on criticality (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Evaluate vendor security posture using questionnaires and public documentation
- Document assessment outcomes with justifications and risk ratings
