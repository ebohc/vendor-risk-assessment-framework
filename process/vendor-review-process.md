This document outlines the standardized steps taken to assess the security and risk posture of new or existing third-party vendors.

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview of Steps

1. **Vendor Identification**
   - Business owner submits a request to onboard a new vendor or tool.

2. **Initial Screening (Pre-Assessment)**
   - GRC team determines whether a full review is required based on:
     - Nature of the service
     - Data sensitivity
     - Network/system integration

3. **Criticality Assessment**
   - Complete the [Vendor Criticality Assessment Template](../templates/vendor-criticality-assessment-template.xlsx)
   - Assign scores and classify vendor as Critical, High, Medium, or Low

4. **Security Questionnaire**
   - Send a baseline questionnaire to the vendor (or gather from trust center)
   - Evaluate responses related to:
     - Data protection
     - Access controls
     - Certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)

5. **Evidence Collection**
   - Review publicly available or shared documents:
     - Penetration test summaries
     - Security policies
     - Data Protection Agreements (DPA)
     - Privacy certifications (GDPR, HIPAA)

6. **Risk Analysis & Recommendations**
   - Summarize risk areas and compensating controls
   - Provide recommendation (Approve, Approve with Conditions, Reject)

7. **Final Approval**
   - Share results with business owner
   - Archive documentation and update risk register

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Vendors classified as **Critical** or **High** must be reassessed annually
- Any vendor storing **PII**, **PCI**, or **health data** requires a DPA
- Tools with AI integration (e.g., code generation) should be evaluated for output explainability and data usage
